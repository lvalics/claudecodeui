# Issue: Add File Metadata Display with Multiple View Modes

## Feature Description

This feature enhances the file tree display by adding file metadata and multiple view modes for better file browsing experience.

### What's New:
- **File metadata display**: Size, permissions (rwx format), and last modified date
- **Three view modes**:
  - **Simple**: Original tree view (file names only)
  - **Compact**: Inline metadata display
  - **Detailed**: Table-like layout with column headers
- **Persistent preferences**: View mode selection saved in localStorage
- **Server-side enhancements**: File stats collection in the API

## Screenshots/Demo

### Detailed View
Shows files in a table format with columns:
- Name | Size | Modified | Permissions

### Compact View  
Shows files with inline metadata:
- filename.js    2.5 KB    rw-r--r--

### Simple View
Original tree structure with just file names and icons

## Implementation Details

### Client-side changes (FileTree.jsx):
- Added view mode state and localStorage persistence
- Created three render functions: `renderFileTree`, `renderCompactView`, `renderDetailedView`
- Added helper functions: `formatFileSize`, `formatRelativeTime`
- Added view mode toggle buttons in the header

### Server-side changes (server/index.js):
- Enhanced `getFileTree` function to collect file stats
- Added `permToRwx` helper function for permission formatting
- Returns additional fields: `size`, `modified`, `permissions`, `permissionsRwx`

## Benefits
1. **Better file overview**: See file sizes and permissions at a glance
2. **Flexible viewing**: Switch between simple and detailed views based on needs
3. **Permission visibility**: Quickly identify file access rights
4. **Recent activity**: See when files were last modified

## Compatibility
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Gracefully handles missing metadata with fallback values
- Works on all platforms (permissions display adapted for Windows)
